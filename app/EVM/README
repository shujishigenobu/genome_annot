# postfix_evm_redundancy.rb

For unknown reasons, EVM produced same genemodels redundantly. This script fixed this problem. Redundant models are removed.


# A guideline for gene modeling using this pipeline (pipeline-2 version)

## 1. Prep

1.1 scripts

Copy necessary scripts from this repo.

1.2 genome

Rename or symbolic link as genome.fa

1.3 evidence file

Create 2 directories: Evidence_source and Evidence_file

evidence source files are copy to ''Evidence_source'' dir (in the original format). The source gff files in original format are converted to EVM compatible gff and saved in ''Evidence_file''. Suggested file name in ''Eidence_file'':

* Dnox.Dcit.p2g.EVMp.gff 
** p2g=protein to genome mapping; e2g=est to genome mapping using exonerate
** EVPp=protein; EVPg=GenePrediction; EVMt=transcript; EVMa:ab initio prediction

gff converters are included in this repo. 

1.4 evidence file concatenation

* gene_predictions.gff3
* transcript_alignments.gff3
* protein_alignments.gff3

## 2. Weight matrix

weights.txt

## 3. Run EVM

1. run_evm_step1_partitioning.sh
2. run_evm_step2_generate_commands.sh
3. split command list for batch jobs
4. batch run
5. run_evm_step3F_recombine_outputs.sh, run_evm_step3R_recombine_outputs.sh
6. run_evm_step4_merge_fwd_rev_gff.sh
7. run_evm_step5_gff3_to_sequences.sh
